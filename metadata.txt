# Environment setup
1. initialized project structure with `langgraph new .`
    a. chose minimal template.
    b. stripped every langgraph related file.
    c. reasons: 
        - strong project foundation (github workflows and dev dependencies on pyproject.toml)
        - future LLM powered app
2. took `uv` official Dockerfile example from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example/blob/main/multistage.Dockerfile and changed last line for streamlit
3. standard docker-compose.yml with development option from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example/blob/main/compose.yml
3. pre-added libraries using `uv add` for latest versions and reduce LLM responsability
5. planned and wrote `initial_prompt.txt`
6. git init and first commit
